Problem Statement:
Write a query that will, for all products, return each product name with the total amount due, paid, canceled, and refunded across all invoices.

Return the result table ordered by product_name in ascending manner.

Sample Input:
Table: invoice

invoice_id	product_id	rest	paid	canceled	refunded
23	0	2	0	5	0
12	0	0	4	0	3
3	1	1	1	1	1
1	1	1	1	1	1
2	1	1	0	1	1
4	1	1	1	0	0

rest is the amount left to pay for this invoice.

paid is the amount paid for this invoice.

canceled is the amount canceled for this invoice.

refunded is the amount refunded for this invoice.

Table: product

product_id	name
0	ham
1	bacon

Sample Output:
name	rest	paid	canceled	refunded
bacon	3	3	3	3
ham	2	4	5	3

Explanation:
The amount of money left to pay for bacon is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3

The amount of money paid for bacon is 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3

The amount of money canceled for bacon is 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

The amount of money refunded for bacon is 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3

The amount of money left to pay for ham is 2 + 0 = 2

The amount of money paid for ham is 0 + 4 = 4

The amount of money canceled for ham is 5 + 0 = 5

The amount of money refunded for ham is 0 + 3 = 3

solution - SELECT
P.name,
SUM(I.rest) as rest,
SUM(I.paid) as paid,
SUM(I.canceled) as canceled,
SUM(I.refunded) as refunded
FROM 
invoice I
INNER JOIN
product P
ON P.PRODUCT_ID = I.product_id
GROUP BY P.name
order by P.name
